 <h3>Make a Difference</h3>

 <p>The scale of the current refugee crisis combined with the magnitude requires innovative responses. As a global community, we must not only be prepared to support those fleeing , but also to support those individuals after resettlement so they can become integrated, contributing members of our communities. The Help Refugees Online does help refugees to build new lives.</p>
 <br>
 
 <p>The crisis in Syria has unleashed one of the worst humanitarian crises in modern history. Roughly 12 million people over half the country’s population have been displaced by the fighting, many seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Syrian parents are faced with enormous obstacles while trying to keep their children safe and healthy.<br><br>

  You can help World Vision meet the urgent needs of Syrian families. And now, your gift works alongside grant funds to go.<br><br>

  Displaced Syrian families lack adequate shelter, food, and basic supplies. World Vision has scaled up our response in places where families have fled, and your help is needed more than ever.<br><br>

  It only takes a little to make a big impact. Just $10 can provide food for a refugee child for a week. $14 can give a child a safe place to learn and play. And for only $4 you can bring solar light to a refugee living in an unsafe area.<br><br>

  We must help Syrian refugees, half of whom are children, by giving them the vital resources they need to keep their children safe, healthy, and secure. Please pray for these families, and give a gift that multiplies to help them today.</p><br>
