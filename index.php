 <p> More than 900,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, according to the UN Refugee Agency. About half of them are from Syria and most are landing in Greece. Make a donation today to help expand and deepen  the refugee crisis in Europe and Middle East; strengthen our programs in the Middle East and other regions; We want to focus internationally attention on the refugee crisis through robust advocacy and communications strategies; and support the resettlement of families to the U.S.
 </p> <br>
 
 <p>Refugees are often forgotten people in need, those turned away from their homes and sometimes their own countries, because of this refugee relief organizations are often understaffed, hence there is a need for refugee relief volunteers.<br><br>
    Help refugee online rises in demand when a new conflict arises and people are in need of immediate aid. Refugee relief volunteers truly make a difference in these time sensitive situations. Volunteers that work with refugee charities abroad are in high-demand as well, as acts such as fundraising and other organizational tasks are hugely helpful when the need for financial support is needed quickly.<br><br>
    If you’re earning a degree in counseling, social work, or sociology, help refugee online will be a priceless experience. You will get a chance to interact with refugee families, help them process how their lives have quickly changed, and help them move forward into the future, however uncertain it may be. This hands on experience with victims of conflict is an altruistic journey unlike any other. </p>
